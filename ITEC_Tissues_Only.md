## ðŸ”· TYPES OF TISSUE IN THE HUMAN BODY

| Type              | Description & Functions                                                             | Example Locations                           |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Epithelial**    | Covers surfaces, lines organs and cavities. Protects, absorbs, secretes.             | Skin, lining of mouth and intestines         |
| **Connective**    | Supports, binds, stores energy, provides immunity.                                   | Bone, cartilage, fat (adipose), blood        |
| **Muscular**      | Contracts to cause movement.                                                         | Skeletal muscles, heart (cardiac), intestines (smooth) |
| **Nervous**       | Transmits electrical impulses to control body functions.                             | Brain, spinal cord, nerves                   |
| **Vascular (Blood & Lymph)** | Transports nutrients, gases, waste; immune function                         | Blood vessels, lymph nodes                   |

### ðŸ§  ITEC EXAM QUICK FACTS â€“ TISSUES

- âœ… **Epithelial** tissue is **avascular** (no blood vessels)
- âœ… **Connective** is the **most abundant** tissue type
- âœ… **Muscular** includes **skeletal (voluntary)**, **cardiac**, and **smooth (involuntary)**
- âœ… **Nervous** tissue is made of **neurons** and **neuroglia**
- âœ… **Blood and lymph** are **liquid connective tissues**

## ðŸ’¡ MEMORY TIPS

- **Epithelial = External + Internal lining**
- **Connective = Connects and supports**
- **Muscular = Movement**
- **Nervous = Nerve signals**
- **Blood = Liquid transport system**
