## üåø FUNCTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

| Function             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fluid balance**     | Returns excess tissue fluid to bloodstream                                  |
| **Immunity**          | Produces lymphocytes (WBCs) and filters pathogens                           |
| **Fat absorption**    | Absorbs fats from digestive tract via lacteals in the small intestine       |
| **Waste removal**     | Removes waste, cellular debris, and toxins from tissues                     |

‚úîÔ∏è The lymphatic system is a one-way drainage system that complements the circulatory system.

## üíß COMPONENTS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

### 1. **Lymph**
- Clear fluid originating from interstitial (tissue) fluid.
- Travels through lymphatic vessels.
- Returns to blood circulation through subclavian veins.

---

### 2. **Lymph Vessels**
- Thin-walled vessels carrying lymph toward the heart.
- Contain **valves** to prevent backflow (like veins).
- Found throughout the body except in the brain and spinal cord.

üß† Remember: **Lymph moves slowly**, assisted by:
- Skeletal muscle contraction
- Breathing movements
- Valves in vessels

---

### 3. **Lymph Nodes**
- Small, bean-shaped structures located along lymphatic vessels.
- Filter lymph and trap pathogens, bacteria, viruses, and abnormal cells.

| Location               | Function                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Cervical nodes**     | Filter lymph from head & neck     |
| **Axillary nodes**     | Drain arms, shoulders, breast     |
| **Inguinal nodes**     | Drain legs and groin              |
| **Mesenteric nodes**   | Drain lymph from intestines       |

‚úîÔ∏è Nodes become swollen during infection due to increased immune activity.

### 4. **Lymph Organs**

| Organ         | Function                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spleen**     | Largest lymphatic organ; filters blood, removes old red blood cells, stores WBCs |
| **Thymus**     | Matures T-lymphocytes (important immune cells); shrinks after puberty  |
| **Tonsils**    | Trap pathogens entering through mouth and nose                         |
| **Bone marrow**| Produces lymphocytes and other blood cells                             |

## üåÄ LYMPHATIC CIRCULATION FLOW

1. Tissue fluid enters **lymphatic capillaries**
2. Becomes **lymph**
3. Moves through **larger lymphatic vessels** with valves
4. Passes through **lymph nodes** for filtration
5. Drains into **thoracic duct** (left side of body + lower right)
6. Right side of upper body drains into **right lymphatic duct**
7. Both ducts empty into **subclavian veins** (into bloodstream)

üß† Mnemonic:
**Capillaries ‚Üí Vessels ‚Üí Nodes ‚Üí Ducts ‚Üí Subclavian veins**

## üõ°Ô∏è IMMUNE ROLE OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

- Produces **lymphocytes** (T-cells and B-cells)
- Traps and destroys antigens (foreign substances)
- Works with the immune system to prevent infection

‚úîÔ∏è White blood cells in lymph nodes = primary defense against infection

## ‚ùó COMMON LYMPHATIC PATHOLOGIES

| Condition        | Description                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lymphoedema**   | Swelling due to blockage or damage in lymph vessels                      |
| **Lymphadenopathy** | Enlarged lymph nodes, often due to infection                           |
| **Hodgkin's Lymphoma** | Cancer of lymphatic system (WBC-related)                             |
| **Tonsillitis**   | Inflammation of tonsils, often due to bacterial or viral infection       |
